# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

  The aim of this project is to build a classifier that can detect credit card fraudulent
transactions. You can use a variety of machine learning algorithms that will be
able to discern fraudulent from non-fraudulent one. By the end of this machine
learning project, you will learn how to implement machine learning algorithms to
perform classification.
